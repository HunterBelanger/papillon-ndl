 *          checked however, due to the fact that the function f is allowed to
 *          be discontinuous. A discontinuity is represented with two adjacent
 *          values in the x array which are equal, each having a difference
 *          associated y value. If the values y[i] do not equal f(x[i])
 *          (barring discontinuities), this function may not finish, or may
 *          yield unexpected results.
 *
 * @param x Reference to the vector of x values which will be kept for linear
 *          interpolation. This vector must be sorted.
 * @param y Reference to the vector of y values which will be kept for linear
 *          interpolation. Must be the same length as x.
 * @param f Function to be linearized.
 * @param tolerance Maximum relative absolute error for linear interpolation.
