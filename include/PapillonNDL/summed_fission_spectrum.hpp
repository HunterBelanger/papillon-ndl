/**
 * @brief In nuclear data evaluations, MT 18 is the reaction which is designated
 *        for fission, and contains the prompt neutron fission spectrum. MT 18
 *        is actually the sum of four other reactions however: MT 19, MT 20, MT
 *        21, and MT 38. These stand for first chance, second chance, third
 *        chance, and fourth chance fission respectively. If these four are
 *        provided insteadd of MT 18, then the prompt fission spectrum is the
 *        average of these four different spectra. This class handles this niche
 * case.
