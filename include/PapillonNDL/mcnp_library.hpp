/**
 * @brief This class is a specialization of the NDLibrary class, which is
 *        constructed from an MCNP formated xsdir file.
 *
 * @warning Due to historical reasons, in many ACE libraries (mostly those
 *          distributed for use with MCNP by LANL), Am242m1 has been given
 *          a ZAID of 95242, and Am242 has been given a ZAID of 95642. If
 *          this is the case for the ACE library you are using, then these
 *          two evaluations will be switched, and looking up the symbol
 *          "Am242" will actually provide the evaluation for Am242m1. This
 *          can be corrected by modifying the xsdir file itself, swaping
 *          the ZAID identifiers for the two evaluations.
